USABILITY IN FREE SOFTWARE

JANCBORCHARDT designer, love to share insights

PROJECTS all free software web apps



FREEDOM collaboration, advantage of open platforms

INNOVATION not just a »free version of X«, be-goal vs do-goal, what do people really need?

HUMANS all for them, even geeks like it simple



DESIGN DICTATOR true, but I believe in education

DESIGNERS DON'T MULTIPLY so share, educate

LOVE you just need love for a project, to improve


DESIGN ↻ TEST most important, both forgotten


DESIGN
Screenshots: ownCloud, Litewrite

SIMPLE (automatic, contextual, less features)

FOCUS (only most important stuff, quality over quantity) focus camera image

REMOVE

SCIENCE

CONTROL (feedback, undo, no modal)



SKETCH!
these all came out of quick mockups

Less features, only implement if it hurts

get inspired, but filter!
your project might have specific target groups
