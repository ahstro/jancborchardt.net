<h1>Keys & bank cards need to go. (draft)</h1>

<p><em>Two stories about the overimportance of physical tokens and the design flaws which make it even worse.</em>

<p>The other day I lost my debit card. I’m with a credit union and don’t live in the same town where the bank is which is unfortunate. Only the ATMs are connected but not the banks themselves – impossible to get any money, even with me being personally in the bank and having photo ID with me.
<p>As far as I’m concerned this is the single task a bank has to do right: Ensure you have access to your money anywhere. Don’t have the plastic card? Your money is still safe, but also from you.

<p>How did I manage to lose it in the first place? I just wanted to get a public transportation ticket. Now the Berlin ticket machines are pretty indifferent to a debit card being shoved into them. After putting in your PIN, you get the ticket, stamp it and get in the train. Wait, <em>where’s the card</em>?
<p>In fact, I remembered this exact mess already happened to me twice before:<br />
The first time I noticed it a few hours later when buying groceries. Gladly I remembered the station, it was right around the corner and some really splendid Zeitgenosse put my card on top of the machine.<br />
The second time there was someone at the machine directly after me. I already ran to the train, although not fast enough for the helpful person. Phew.<br />
I called the BVG lost & found this time, without success. As a proper Wutbürger I took the chance to mention my discontent with the ticket machines: »That’s why it says on the display: ›Please take your card.‹« – right. How many calls do you get about this bullshit?

Simple solution (just regarding the mechanism design flaw):
Only spit out the ticket once the card has been retracted. This is how ATM machines work.

Good solution:
Square? Opentabs?



A few months ago I locked myself out. My flatmate and I wanted to go out to get stuffed on Baklava. There were only 2 keys to the sublet – we both forgot ours inside. Since we noticed that a split-second after the door was closed it would have been no problem, were it not for the door locking when you close it. An insecure lock, enough for the most expensive Baklava I ever had.
It was a Sunday evening so we had to pay 300 Euros for the helpful locksmith using his plastic card a few times to get the door open.
The key, a small piece of metal you only need once or twice a day to get back into the house. Yet you carry it around the whole day with two options: keep it, or lose it. Like playing Tetris – you will fail, it’s only a matter of time. Bigger and better locks only go so far, there is still a key to circumvent all that. Then you even make copies of this thing. And if you lose one everything needs to be changed. (This is the same reason why I don’t like SSH and GPG keys.)

Simple solution (only regarding the mechanism):
In Israel (and presumably other countries) the door does not lock when you close it. And in case you think you will forget to lock it – this is exactly how car doors work. (Yes, cars need the key to start. Another problem, not this time.) If you want the door locked you just do it. You can never 

Good solution:
My bike has a combination lock. I never have to carry a key, never forgot the code, and can easily share the combination if I so choose. It’s like the lock isn’t even there.
A combination lock can also scramble as soon as you close it. 
jankodesign combination lock
knock detecting lock

COMBINATION LOCK KEY!
forms the key when the combination is right
secure so it can’t be removed

It’s about time we are not dependent on physical tokens
