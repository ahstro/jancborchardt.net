# Reasons design in open source is difficult, or why open source has bad design

AND HOW TO FIX IT

## Why it's hard to be a designer in open source:
- projects do not have contribution docs for designers
- projects do not have their website source code available
- projects do not make it easy to find source files
- git is very hard, even with the best interface. It's not automatic and the language (commit, push, pull) is confusing. → SparkleShare
- sketch, illustrator etc not SVG

- People think design has to be done holistically and can not be broken up like software → You can use design systems, styleguides and have a big team
- Licenses are confusing. Most are focused on code only and there's too many. → Creative Commons
- There are more developers in open source than designers, so any vote is going to result in issues. → Don't do voting, do educated decisions based on research, what others do, and usability testing.
- CI/CD mean two totally different things in design and development
- "So you do database design?"
- "Linux is about choice"
- Copyright is seen as positive in design circles → Everything is a remix
- Design is not highlighted → Open Source Design, design tag in repo
- Tools are difficult to use → OSD job board
-  universities teach "indistry standard" Illustrator, Sketch, etc → Education
- There’s complicated tools necessary to get involved in it. Git for starters, terminology already too confusing, and not automatic → Sparkleshare, (Github desktop, Git-it, lennerd version tutorial)
- Contribution pages are focused on developing code → Design contribute pagr
- The culture can be toxic. → Code of conduct
- Design work is not valued so much.
- Everyone has an opinion on design.
- People think settings and options are great.
- Integration testing is valued, usability testing is not.
- The .git folder is visible?
- Github says "Built for developers"
- even with Github desktop it's still difficult to use: push/pull/fetch/commit wording, not automatic, Not possible to drag & drop files into Githib desktop, big description field
- Github offers to set a license, but you can't choose Creative Commons, only code licenses
- Github has a file size limit of 100 MB.
- Github offers to set a .gitignore, but there's no simple default to exclude .DS_Store and the like, only for languages
- Github does not count comments (design discussion in issues) towards the log
- GitLab offers to set CI, or add Kubernetes cluster, etc
- Markdown files, which are the standard for readmes, can not be opened by default on Windows and macOS
- "README.md" is not exactly welcoming
- People think that open source means you are not getting paid. → Open Source Design job board
- The word "free software" adds to this confusion

## What’s better for designers in open source
- SVGs can be diffed
- No problem with using resources because of unclear licensing.
- Open source and distributed teams encourage documentation and validating your design
