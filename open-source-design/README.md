REALTIME CONF EU

REALTIME DESIGN
(design, perception, psychology)

Less focused on the technological part, but on the underlying human factors. What does »realtime« mean for users, how is it perceived, how can we design for it?

You’ll learn about fundamental psychological principles which help you to better design for realtime. The difference between the software being perceived as sluggish or snappy is often just a matter of realtime feedback.

I’ll also discuss the pitfalls and consequences of what realtime enables: What about distractions caused by data flowing in all the time, notifications, incoming shiny new things which are hard to resist – can we handle that in the software we create short of just pushing it out to people?

MULTIPLE CHANNELS
apple mail sound sent feedback

OFFLINE!
As Jan already said yesterday: The device itself always has the lowest latency.
Caching
don’t wait for the server to display feedback
irc skype gtalk sent messages display, direct, greyed, spinner, warning afterwards?

ERRORS
also human
you really want to delete?

RELEVANCE
»time« is not the defining factor in lots of things.
New email comes in – is that important? Likely not.

ALERTS
ms alert box
we thought we are kind of over that
* iOS itself: Battery warning 20% – what significance does 20% have? I don’t even know how much I have left. (one time it even interrupted me while I was typing my password, overlaying a modal with a modal) then just shuts down when it’s 0. Instead just show the top bar part where the battery is
* loads of other modals
Clippy!

Only interrupt me if it's important
Like a good personal assistant, shield people from unimportant minutiae. People want to stay focused, and unless it's critical and time-sensitive, an interruption can be taxing and frustrating.
