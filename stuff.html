<p>This is <a href="#own">stuff I have</a>, <a href="#dontown">stuff I don’t have</a> and <a href="#giveaway">stuff I give away</a>.


<h1 id="own"><a href="#own">Everything I own</a></h1>
<em>Fits in a carry-on backpack, costs about 1000 € and weighs ~8 kg.</em>
<p>I’m a partisan of <a href="http://www.thoughtcrime.org/blog/the-worst/">The Worst</a>, so my stuff isn’t the best of it’s kind, and definitely not the most expensive, but rather a good balance which I can trust and not worry about damaging at the same time.
<p>This stuff is reasonably good for all-weather, and works for -10° C snowy Europe as well as 30° sunny South East Asia. I’m quite resistant to the cold though, so the exact jacket, pants or number of layers might vary for you.

<h2>Tech</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>laptop</strong>+charger<br>
	Needs to be light, small and have a great battery life. That’s why I got a <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/">Samsung Chromebook</a> (300 €, 1500 g), but put <a href="http://chromeos-cr48.blogspot.com">ChrUbuntu</a> on it.
	Chromebooks are ok because they are small, light, have great battery life, a good touchpad and run Linux. Almost all <a href="http://retrofatty.blogspot.de/2013/02/chrubuntu-install-and-fixes.html">hardware compatibility issues have fixes</a>.

	<li><strong>earphones</strong><br>
	<a href="//www.p4c.philips.com/cgi-bin/dcbint/cpindex.pl?ctn=SHE9000/28">Philips SHE9000</a> (28 €, 10 g) are great small, reasonably priced and well-designed in-ear headphones. The plug is angled for less obstruction and the cable is partly fiber-coated to prevent tangled cords. They are even useful on their own just for noise cancellation.

	<li><strong>phone</strong>+cable<br>
	<a href="https://geeksphone.com">Geeksphone Peak</a> (160 €), the first Firefox OS developer phone.

	<li><strong>storage</strong><br>
	<a href="//www.sandisk.com/products/usb-flash-drives/cruzer-fit-usb-flash-drive">Sandisk Cruzer Fit Z33</a> 16GB (13 €), for backup, transfer and Ubuntu. It’s so small I just leave it in the laptop anyway.

	<li class="external"><strong>external</strong><br>
	Other than what I have with me, I need power & wifi of course. I prefer cafés (<a href="http://coworfing.com">Coworfing</a>) over coworkingspaces because both tend to be loud but cafés are less expensive and more flexible.
</ul>

<h2>Clothes</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>jacket</strong><br>
	<a href="//www.mammut.ch/en/productDetail/101005171_v_0001_M/Ultimate-Hoody-Men.html?cid=923493">Mammut Ultimate Hoody</a> (250 €, 540 g) is really good, light and I find myself wearing it all the time. It’s a bit expensive though. Would probably not get it again, but rather a simpler softshell jacket.

	<li><strong>sweater</strong><br>
	A standard dark grey longsleeve pullover (10 €, 290 g) from H&M. Useful for when it’s a bit colder, and the only longsleeve I have next to the jacket.

	<li><strong>shirts</strong><br>
	3 T-shirts (ea. 5 €, 130 g), preferably blank.

	<li><strong>pants</strong><br>
	I only have one pair of long pants, Zara slim (40 €). Then a pair of shorts which can also be used for sports and swimming.

	<li><strong>underwear</strong><br>
	3 pair (10 €), simple.

	<li><strong>shoes</strong><br>
	Sandals, currently <a href="http://www.unshoesusa.com/feather.html">Unshoes Wokova Feather</a> (50 €). Then a pair of <strong>simple sneakers</strong> for skateboarding or other occasions. I often just go barefoot.

	<li class="external"><strong>external</strong><br>
	A roof and floor to sleep, usually at friends, <a href="http://nomadbase.org">Nomadbases</a> or short-time sublets.
	When clothes need to be washed, I usually hand wash in the evening and let it dry overnight on a radiator.
</ul>

<h2>Hygiene</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>brush teeth</strong><br>
	<a href="//www.dr-best.de/produkte/zahnbuersten_erwachsene/atemfrisch.jsp">Dr. Best breath fresh</a> (3 €) is the best toothbrush. Ergonomic handle, great brush, tongue scraper and more details. Plus any small toothpaste.

	<li><strong>clean</strong><br>
	For showering I use a <strong>soap bar</strong>, preferably lipid balancing.

	<li><strong>dry</strong><br>
	<a href="//cascadedesigns.com/packtowl">Packtowl</a> M (17 €, 50 g) feels weird, but most places have towels and it’s a small one still useful for emergencies.

	<li><strong>deodorant</strong><br>
	I prefer a clear roll-on without distinct scent.

	<li><strong>cut</strong><br>
	Haircuts I do myself, and <strong>scissors</strong> are also useful to cut nails and in general for fixing up stuff. Still searching for a good one, but will probably be a small kids scissorcs with blunt tip so it can be carried on an airplane.

	<li><strong>shave</strong><br>
	A simple safety razor for the occasional shave.

	<li><strong>tape</strong><br>
	Gaffer or medical tape rolled up in itself, perfect for fixing small things.

	<li><strong>tissues</strong><br>
	For sneezing, fixing wounds, wiping and more.

	<li class="external"><strong>external</strong><br>
	shower & toilet
</ul>

<h2>Tools</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>pack</strong><br>
	<a href="http://www.haglofs.com/en-us/products/backpacksbags/daypacks/unisex/corker_medium_en-us.aspx">Haglöfs Corker 18l</a> (60 €, 820 g) is a light, nice looking backpack with a good amount of compartments.
	Other backpacks I considered but didn’t try are <a href="http://www.amazon.de/Deuter-Trendline-Speed-Rucksack-midnight-ocean/dp/B0042J8CV4">Deuter Speed Lite 20</a>, <a href="http://ortlieb.com/_prod.php?lang=en&produkt=packmanpro2">Ortlieb Packman 20</a>, <a href="www.amazon.de/Mammut-Xeron-Flip-22L-black-smoke/dp/B005LBYH7K">Mammut Xeron Flip 22</a>.

	<li><strong>sketch</strong><br>
	Any pen & paper. I prefer Bic pens and softcover Moleskines.

	<li><strong>money</strong><br>
	Some cash, debit card, credit card, and a tan generator.

	<li><strong>ID</strong><br>
	I rarely drive but the <strong>drivers license</strong> is good as small photo ID. And a <strong>passport</strong> for traveling.

	<li><strong>health</strong><br>
	Passes for insurance, vaccination, radiology & organ donation.

	<li class="external"><strong>external</strong><br>
	I love to <strong>bike</strong> so I always like using one wherever I’m at. I fixed up and gifted several bikes myself and usually someone has a bike they’re not using.

<h1 id="dontown"><a href="#dontown">Stuff I don’t own</a></h1>
<ul>
	<li><strong>2nd pair of pants</strong><br>
	I used to have two, but pants don’t need to be washed that often. And if the one pair does, it dries overnight easily.
	<li><strong>belt</strong><br>
	Fitting pants don’t need a belt.
	<li><strong>state ID</strong><br>
	Is redundant because of passport and driver’s license.
	<li><strong>pocket knife</strong><br>
	I used to, but found I only use the blade or scissors anyway.
	<li><strong>shampoo</strong><br>
	Soap works perfectly for that. Also, I don’t wash it too often or with much soap to not damage the skin.
	<li><strong>hat</strong><br>
	The only headgear I have is the jacket’s hood, and it suffices even for skiing in hail.
	<li><strong>power-USB adapter</strong><br>
	Mobile devices can be charged from the laptop, no need for an extra adapter.
	<li><strong>wallet</strong><br>
	Would be overkill for the few things I have to put in it. Either it’s in the jacket pockets or in the backpack.
	<li><strong>sleeping bag</strong><br>
	I used to have the <a href="http://www.amazon.de/Rix-4651-MUMIENSCHLAFSACK-LIGHT-600/dp/B0012K4XJQ">Rix Light 600</a> (20 €, 740 g). It can’t be used outside in the winter though, but I rarely do that and most places I am have sleeping bags or sheets anyway. I found I don’t use it so I gave it away.
	<li><strong>special water bottle</strong><br>
	I just use regular ones and refill them.
</ul>





<h1 class="taken" id="giveaway"><a href="#giveaway">Stuff I give away</a></h1>
