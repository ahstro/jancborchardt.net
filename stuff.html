<ul>
	<li id="laptop"><h3><a href="#laptop">Laptop</a></h3>
	Needs to be light, thin and have a great battery life. The <a href="https://puri.sm/shop/librem-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Purism Librem 13</a> has great design &amp; build quality, hardware switches for camera/microphone &amp; wireless, and it runs nicely with <a href="https://ubuntu.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubuntu</a> + <a href="https://www.gnome.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GNOME</a>.<br>
	Otherwise the <a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/de/Linux-Hardware/Linux-Notebooks/10-14-Zoll/TUXEDO-InfinityBook-14-14-Zoll-matt-Full-HD-IPS-Aluminiumgehaeuse-Intel-Core-i5-CPU-8GB-RAM-sehr-lange-Akkulaufzeit-USB-Typ-C.tuxedo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tuxedo InfinityBook</a> seems good as well.<br>
	Still looking forward to more fair production processes in laptops too.

	<li id="phone"><h3><a href="#phone">Phone</a></h3>
	The <a href="https://www.fairphone.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fairphone 2</a> of course. Itâ€™s fairly produced and components can be switched out easily. I use it with <a href="https://code.fairphone.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fairphone Open</a>, and it can also be used with <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/FP2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LineageOS</a>. Apps I get through <a href="https://f-droid.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F-Droid</a>.<br>
	The phone plan is from <a href="http://goood.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">goood</a>.

	<li id="earphones"><h3><a href="#earphones">Earphones</a></h3>
	The <a href="https://lstnsound.co/collections/earbuds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LSTN Avalon</a> are nice in-ear headphones made from wood. The plug is weirdly angled and quite big though, and the buds make a strange noise when put in. They are great for noise-isolation and silence when sleeping.

	<li id="screen"><h3><a href="#screen">Screen</a></h3>
	The <a href="http://eu.aoc.com/en/products/i2475pxqu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AOC I2475PXQU</a> is a very nice adjustable external 24" display for working. It is basically the only monitor I could find which is matt and fulfilled Energy Star, TCO & EPEAT Gold.

<article id="clothes">
<h2><a href="#clothes">Clothes</a></h2>
<ul>
	<li id="shirts"><h3><a href="#shirts">Shirts, underpants, socks & sweater</a></h3>
	All <a href="https://icebreaker.co.nz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Icebreaker merino wool</a>. 4 t-shirts, 4 underpants, 4 socks & 1 longsleeve.<br>
	Merino because itâ€™s anti-bacterial and does not smell easily. Often you can just air it out. Downside is that they put the logo on the arm, which with some luck you can remove after some time. Will switch to <a href="https://eu.patagonia.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patagonia</a> since their practices are more ethical.

	<li id="pants"><h3><a href="#pants">Pants</a></h3>
	One pair of <a href="https://www.armedangels.de/en/maenner-chino-basic-brandon-10251597-105.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">armedangels Brandon chino pants</a>. Then a pair of Prana Hybridizer shorts which can also be used for sports and swimming.<br>
	Iâ€™m also currently trying out <a href="http://www.zephyrberlin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zephyr pants</a> but am not sure about the style. Might try the <a href="https://shop.bluffworks.com/products/original-regular-fit-travel-pants-true-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bluffworks regular fit travel pants</a>. Recommendations welcome!

	<li id="jacket"><h3><a href="#jacket">Jacket</a></h3>
	<a href="https://www.mammut.com/p/1011-00061-0052/ultimate-v-so-hooded-jacket-men/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mammut Ultimate</a> is really good, light and I find myself wearing it all the time. (I have an older version. Glued the side zippers to stay put on the bottom part, and painted the logos black with textile marker.)<br>
	I will switch to the <a href="http://eu.patagonia.com/en/product/mens-levitation-hoody/83030.html?dwvar_83030_color=BLK" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patagonia Levitation Hoody</a> when the other jacket is worn down since their ethics and production practices are better.

	<li id="shoes"><h3><a href="#shoes">Shoes</a></h3>
	<a href="https://www.vivobarefoot.com/eu/mens/everyday/ra-ii-mens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vivobarefoot Ra II</a> are my only closed shoe no matter the season.<br>
	As sandals I currently use the <a href="https://bedrocksandals.com/products/classic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bedrock Classic</a>. Others I like are <a href="http://www.unshoesusa.com/Wokova-Feather-Sandal_p_16.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unshoes Wokova Feather</a> and <a href="https://www.earthrunners.com/products/elemental" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Earthrunners Elemental</a> (when they were still full black). The <a href="http://www.unshoesusa.com/Keota-Sandal_p_35.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unshoes Wokova Feather</a> seem nice too but I didnâ€™t try them yet.

<article id="hygiene">
<h2><a href="#hygiene">Hygiene</a></h2>
<ul>
	<li id="toothbrush"><h3><a href="#toothbrush">Toothbrush</a></h3>
	I use bamboo brushes because their handles are less bad for the environment than plastic ones. The <a href="http://www.hydrophil.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hydrophil bamboo brush</a> is pretty nice. With it <a href=" https://www.neobio.de/en/products/dental-hygiene.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neobio fluoride toothpaste</a> which is one of the only well-rated organic toothpastes.

	<li id="soap"><h3><a href="#soap">Soap</a></h3>
	For showering I use a <a href="https://www.drbronner.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Bronnerâ€™s eukalyptus soap</a>. Can also be used as shaving cream and is fully biodegradable.

	<li id="deodorant"><h3><a href="#deodorant">Deodorant</a></h3>
	The <a href="https://www.iplusm.berlin/produkt/wild-life-for-men-deo-roll-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">i+m deo roll-on</a> is the only aluminum-free and organic deodorant I found which works. (Downsides are that itâ€™s expensive and I prefer spray because thereâ€™s lighter and smaller containers.)

	<li id="shave"><h3><a href="#shave">Shave, hair & nails</a></h3>
	<a href="https://standardrazors.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Standard Razors</a> are really nice safety razors. Much better than a cartridge razor and less wasteful. Any regular safety razor is good too.<br>
	Haircuts I do myself with barber scissors.<br>
	For nails I have a simple metal nail clipper.

<ul>
	<li id="backpack"><h3><a href="#backpack">Backpack</a></h3>
	The <a href="https://www.pinqponq.com/en/cubik-medium-acid-black/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pinqponq Cubik Medium</a> has 19l of space, good compartments, looks great and is made of recycled materials.<br>
	Otherwise the <a href="http://www.haglofs.com/en-us/products/backpacksbags/daypacks/unisex/corker_medium_en-us.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HaglÃ¶fs Corker 18l</a> is a great backpack I used for a long time.

	<li id="money"><h3><a href="#money">Money</a></h3>
	Bank account at <a href="https://gls.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GLS bank</a>. They are a sustainable and ecological bank. Investments are only made in companies with proper standards. Also see <a href="https://www.fairfinanceguide.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fair Finance Guide</a> and <a href="http://www.facing-finance.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facing Finance</a>.

	<li id="id"><h3><a href="#id">ID</a></h3>
	I rarely drive but the <strong>drivers license</strong> is good as small photo ID. And a <strong>passport</strong> for traveling. A national ID is not necessary.

	<li id="health"><h3><a href="#health">Health</a></h3>
	Passes for insurance, vaccination, radiology &amp; <a href="https://www.organspende-info.de/organspendeausweis/bestellen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organ donation</a>. Also register for bone marrow donation at <a href="https://www.dkms.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DKMS</a>.

	<li id="bed"><h3><a href="#bed">Bed</a></h3>
	<a href="https://www.kiezbett.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kiezbett</a> is a really nice bed, regionally and sustainably produced from Berlin.

	<li id="bicycle"><h3><a href="#bicycle">Bicycle</a></h3>
	I love to bike and my <a href="http://cinelli.it/en/prodotti/gazzetta-en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cinelli Gazzetta 2016</a> track bike is great fun. ðŸ˜Š My next bike will be a bamboo bike like the one by <a href="http://www.starkbamboobike.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stark</a> or a self-made at <a href="https://www.ozoncyclery.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OZON Cyclery</a>.<br>
	Since chain lube is based on petroleum, use the <a href="http://www.orontas.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biodegradable chain lube by Orontas</a>.
