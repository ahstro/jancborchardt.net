		<p>Fits in a carry-on backpack. I try to strike a balance between quality and sustainability.<br>This stuff is reasonably good for all-weather, and works for -10° C snowy Europe as well as 30° sunny Southeast Asia.</p>

	Needs to be light, thin and have a great battery life. The <a href="https://puri.sm/shop/librem-13/">Purism Librem 13</a> has great design &amp; build quality, hardware switches for camera/microphone &amp; wireless, and it runs nicely with <a href="https://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> + <a href="https://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a>.<br>
	Otherwise the <a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/de/Linux-Hardware/Linux-Notebooks/10-14-Zoll/TUXEDO-InfinityBook-14-14-Zoll-matt-Full-HD-IPS-Aluminiumgehaeuse-Intel-Core-i5-CPU-8GB-RAM-sehr-lange-Akkulaufzeit-USB-Typ-C.tuxedo">Tuxedo InfinityBook</a> seems good as well.<br>
	Still looking forward to more fair production processes in laptops as well.

	<li id="phone"><h3><a href="#phone">Phone</a></h3>
	The <a href="https://www.fairphone.com">Fairphone 2</a> of course. It’s fairly produced and components can be switched out easily. I use it with <a href="https://code.fairphone.com/">Fairphone Open</a>, and it can also be used with <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/FP2">LineageOS</a>. The phone plan is from <a href="http://goood.de/">goood</a>.

	<li id="earphones"><h3><a href="#earphones">Earphones</a></h3>
	The <a href="https://lstnsound.co/collections/earbuds">LSTN Avalon</a> are nice in-ear headphones made from wood. The plug is weirdly angled and quite big though, and the buds make a strange noise when put in. They are great for noise-isolation and silence when sleeping.

	<li id="screen"><h3><a href="#screen">Screen</a></h3>
	The <a href="http://eu.aoc.com/en/products/i2475pxqu">AOC I2475PXQU</a> is a very nice adjustable external 24" display for working. It is basically the only monitor I could find which is matt and fulfilled Energy Star, TCO & EPEAT Gold.

<article id="clothes">
<h2><a href="#clothes">Clothes</a></h2>
<ul>
	<li id="shirts"><h3><a href="#shirts">Shirts, underpants, socks & sweater</a></h3>
	All <a href="https://icebreaker.co.nz/">Icebreaker merino wool</a>. 4 t-shirts, 4 underpants, 4 socks & 1 longsleeve.<br>
	Merino because it’s anti-bacterial and does not smell easily. Often you can just air it out. Downside is that they put the logo on the arm, which with some luck you can remove after some time. Will switch to <a href="https://eu.patagonia.com/">Patagonia</a> since their practices are more ethical.

	<li id="pants"><h3><a href="#pants">Pants</a></h3>
	One pair of <a href="https://www.armedangels.de/en/maenner-chino-basic-brandon-10251597-105.html">armedangels Brandon chino pants</a>. Then a pair of shorts which can also be used for sports and swimming.<br>
	I’m also currently trying out <a href="http://www.zephyrberlin.com/">Zephyr pants</a> but am not sure about the style. Might try the <a href="https://shop.bluffworks.com/products/original-regular-fit-travel-pants-true-black">Bluffworks regular fit travel pants</a>. Recommendations welcome!

	<li id="jacket"><h3><a href="#jacket">Jacket</a></h3>
	<a href="//www.mammut.ch/en/productDetail/101005171_v_0001_M/Ultimate-Hoody-Men.html?cid=923493">Mammut Ultimate Hoody</a> is really good, light and I find myself wearing it all the time. I modified the side zippers to stay locked on the bottom part.<br>
	I will switch to the <a href="http://eu.patagonia.com/en/product/mens-levitation-hoody/83030.html?dwvar_83030_color=BLK">Patagonia Levitation Hoody</a> when the other jacket is worn down since their ethics and production practices are better.

	<li id="shoes"><h3><a href="#shoes">Shoes</a></h3>
	<a href="https://www.vivobarefoot.com/eu/mens/everyday/ra-ii-mens">Vivobarefoot Ra II</a> are my only closed shoe no matter the season.<br>
	As sandals the <a href="https://www.earthrunners.com/products/elemental">Earthrunners Elemental</a> basic model when it was still available in black. The <a href="http://www.unshoesusa.com/Wokova-Feather-Sandal_p_16.html">Unshoes Wokova Feather</a> are nice as well.

<ul>
	<li id="toothbrush"><h3><a href="#toothbrush">Toothbrush</a></h3>
	I use bamboo brushes because their handles are less bad for the environment than plastic ones. The <a href="http://www.hydrophil.com/">Hydrophil bamboo brush</a> is pretty nice. Plus any toothpaste.

	<li id="soap"><h3><a href="#soap">Soap</a></h3>
	For showering I use a <a href="https://www.drbronner.com/">Dr. Bronner’s eukalyptus soap</a>. Can also be used as shaving cream and is fully biodegradable.

	<li id="deodorant"><h3><a href="#deodorant">Deodorant</a></h3>
	I prefer a clear spray without distinct scent.

	<li id="shave"><h3><a href="#shave">Shave, hair & nails</a></h3>
	<a href="https://standardrazors.com/">Standard Razors</a> are really nice safety razors. Much better than a cartridge razor and less wasteful. Any regular safety razor is good too.<br>
	Haircuts I do myself with barber scissors.<br>
	For nails I have a simple metal nail clipper.

	<li id="backpack"><h3><a href="#backpack">Backpack</a></h3>
	The <a href="https://www.pinqponq.com/en/cubik-medium-acid-black/">pinqponq Cubik Medium</a> has 19l of space, good compartments, looks great and is made of recycled materials.<br>
	Otherwise the <a href="http://www.haglofs.com/en-us/products/backpacksbags/daypacks/unisex/corker_medium_en-us.aspx">Haglöfs Corker 18l</a> is a great backpack I used for a long time.

	<li id="money"><h3><a href="#money">Money</a></h3>
	Bank account at <a href="https://gls.de/">GLS bank</a>. They are a sustainable and ecological bank. Investments are only made in companies with proper standards.

	<li id="id"><h3><a href="#id">ID</a></h3>
	I rarely drive but the <strong>drivers license</strong> is good as small photo ID. And a <strong>passport</strong> for traveling. A national ID is not necessary.

	<li id="health"><h3><a href="#health">Health</a></h3>
	Passes for insurance, vaccination, radiology &amp; <a href="https://www.organspende-info.de/organspendeausweis/bestellen">organ donation</a>. Also register for bone marrow donation at <a href="https://www.dkms.org/en">DKMS</a>.

	<li id="bed"><h3><a href="#bed">Bed</a></h3>
	<a href="https://www.kiezbett.com/">Kiezbett</a> is a really nice bed, regionally and sustainably produced from Berlin.

	<li id="bicycle"><h3><a href="#bicycle">Bicycle</a></h3>
	I love to bike and my <a href="http://cinelli.it/en/prodotti/gazzetta-en/">Cinelli Gazzetta 2016</a> track bike is great fun. :) In the future, a bamboo bike like the one by <a href="http://www.starkbamboobike.com/">Stark</a> might be good.<br>
	Since chain lube is based on petroleum, use the <a href="http://www.orontas.com/">biodegradable chain lube by Orontas</a>.
