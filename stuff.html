<p>This is <a href="#own">stuff I have</a>, <a href="#dontown">stuff I don’t have</a> and <a href="#giveaway">stuff I give away</a>.


<h1 id="own"><a href="#own">Everything I own</a></h1>
<em>Fits in a carry-on backpack, costs about 1000 € and weighs ~8 kg.</em>
<p>I’m a partisan of <a href="http://www.thoughtcrime.org/blog/the-worst/">The Worst</a>, so my stuff isn’t the best of it’s kind, and definitely not the most expensive, but rather a good balance which I can trust and not worry about damaging at the same time.
<p>This stuff is reasonably good for all-weather, and works for -10° C snowy Europe as well as 30° sunny South East Asia. I’m quite resistant to the cold though, so the exact jacket, pants or number of layers might vary for you.

<h2>Tech</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>laptop</strong>+charger<br>
	Needs to be light, small and have a great battery life. That’s why I got a <a href="//www.samsung.com/us/computer/chrome-os-devices/XE500C21-A04US?">Samsung Series 5 Chromebook</a> (300 €, 1500 g), but put <a href="//ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> + <a href="//gnome.org">Gnome Shell</a> on it.<br>
	Requirement for any new one: &gt;6h battery, 12" or less, SSD, big touchpad, 2–4 GB RAM, &lt;500 €, light, silent, runs Ubuntu)
	Potential candidates are <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/">a newer Chromebook</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.de/F201E-KX065DU-Netbook-Celeron-Ubuntu-schwarz/dp/B009NCTDC2">Asus F201E</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B009UROJDI/">Acer Aspire One</a>.


	<li><strong>earphones</strong><br>
	<a href="//www.p4c.philips.com/cgi-bin/dcbint/cpindex.pl?ctn=SHE9000/28">Philips SHE9000</a> (28 €, 10 g) are great small, reasonably priced and well-designed in-ear headphones. The plug is angled for less obstruction and the cable is partly fiber-coated to prevent tangled cords. They are even useful on their own just for noise cancellation.

	<li><strong>phone</strong>+cable<br>
	Still a Google G1 … next one will probably be a <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/01/announcing-the-firefox-os-developer-preview-phone/">Firefox OS developer phone</a>. Or maybe a <a href="https://www.google.com/nexus/4/">Google Nexus 4</a>. As soon as I get the new phone I’ll probably also get a new data plan making me independent from wifi.

	<li><strong>storage</strong><br>
	<a href="//www.sandisk.com/products/usb-flash-drives/cruzer-fit-usb-flash-drive">Sandisk Cruzer Fit Z33</a> 16GB (13 €), for backup, transfer and Ubuntu. It’s so small I just leave it in the laptop anyway.

	<li class="external"><strong>external</strong><br>
	Other than what I have with me, I need power & wifi of course. I prefer cafés (<a href="http://coworfing.com">Coworfing</a>) over coworkingspaces because both tend to be loud but cafés are less expensive and more flexible.
</ul>

<h2>Clothes</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>jacket</strong><br>
	<a href="//www.mammut.ch/en/productDetail/101005171_v_0001_M/Ultimate-Hoody-Men.html?cid=923493">Mammut Ultimate Hoody</a> (250 €, 540 g) is really good, light and I find myself wearing it all the time. It’s a bit expensive though. Would probably not get it again, but rather a simpler softshell jacket.

	<li><strong>sweater</strong><br>
	A standard dark grey longsleeve pullover (10 €, 290 g) from H&M. Useful for when it’s a bit colder, and the only longsleeve I have next to the jacket.

	<li><strong>shirts</strong><br>
	3 T-shirts (ea. 5 €, 130 g), preferably blank. I’m looking at getting one Icebreaker merino wool shirt because they seem to be really good and rarely need to be washed, but with ~50 € each they are really expensive.

	<li><strong>pants</strong><br>
	I only have one pair of long pants, Zara slim (40 €). Then 2 pairs of swimshorts which I use as underwear, but can also be used as regular shorts and for sports.

	<li><strong>shoes</strong><br>
	One pair of <strong>sandals</strong>, one pair of <strong>simple sneakers</strong>, or just go barefoot. I like sandals and try lots of them, currently <a href="http://www.unshoesusa.com/feather.html">Unshoes Wokova Feather</a> (50 €). But they are a bit expensive and I find myself wearing simple flip-flops again despite disliking them previously. The sneakers I only use in winter, and also need 2 pairs of socks for them. As for sandals, <a href="http://www.amazon.de/Kickers-204971-60-92-Sandalen-Fashion-Sandalen/dp/B005ZCBFE8/">Kickers Ibis</a> also seem good.

	<li class="external"><strong>external</strong><br>
	A roof and floor to sleep, usually at friends, <a href="http://nomadbase.org">Nomadbases</a> or short-time sublets.
	When clothes need to be washed, I usually hand wash in the evening and let it dry overnight on a radiator.
</ul>

<h2>Hygiene</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>brush teeth</strong><br>
	<a href="//www.dr-best.de/produkte/zahnbuersten_erwachsene/atemfrisch.jsp">Dr. Best breath fresh</a> (3 €) is the best toothbrush. Ergonomic handle, great brush, tongue scraper and more details. Plus any small toothpaste.

	<li><strong>clean</strong><br>
	For showering I use a <strong>soap bar</strong>, preferably lipid balancing.

	<li><strong>dry</strong><br>
	<a href="//cascadedesigns.com/packtowl">Packtowl</a> M (17 €, 50 g) feels weird, but most places have towels and it’s a small one still useful for emergencies.

	<li><strong>deodorant</strong><br>
	I prefer a clear roll-on without distinct scent.

	<li><strong>cut</strong><br>
	Haircuts I do myself, and <strong>scissors</strong> are also useful to cut nails and in general for fixing up stuff. Still searching for a good one, but will probably be a small kids scissorcs with blunt tip so it can be carried on an airplane.

	<li><strong>shave</strong><br>
	A simple safety razor for the occasional shave.

	<li><strong>tape</strong><br>
	Gaffer or medical tape rolled up in itself, perfect for fixing small things.

	<li><strong>tissues</strong><br>
	For sneezing, fixing wounds, wiping and more.

	<li class="external"><strong>external</strong><br>
	shower & toilet
</ul>

<h2>Tools</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>pack</strong><br>
	<a href="http://www.haglofs.com/en-us/products/backpacksbags/daypacks/unisex/corker_medium_en-us.aspx">Haglöfs Corker 18l</a> (60 €, 820 g) is a light, nice looking backpack with a good amount of compartments.
	Other backpacks I considered but didn’t try are <a href="http://www.amazon.de/Deuter-Trendline-Speed-Rucksack-midnight-ocean/dp/B0042J8CV4">Deuter Speed Lite 20</a>, <a href="http://ortlieb.com/_prod.php?lang=en&produkt=packmanpro2">Ortlieb Packman 20</a>, <a href="www.amazon.de/Mammut-Xeron-Flip-22L-black-smoke/dp/B005LBYH7K">Mammut Xeron Flip 22</a>.

	<li><strong>sleep</strong><br>
	<a href="http://www.amazon.de/Rix-4651-MUMIENSCHLAFSACK-LIGHT-600/dp/B0012K4XJQ">Rix Light 600</a> (20 €, 740 g) is a cheap and light random sleeping bag which can easily be carried around. It can’t be used outside in the winter though, but I rarely do that and most places I am have sleeping bags or sheets anyway.<br>
	It’s a bit big though so I’m searching for a smaller one. I want to test McKinley Light 600 and Salewa Lite Lion as well as the very small silk ones.

	<li><strong>sketch</strong><br>
	Simple pen & paper, any will do. I prefer Bic pens and small stacks of paper.

	<li><strong>money</strong><br>
	Some cash, debit card, credit card, and a tan generator which I want to get rid of.

	<li><strong>ID</strong><br>
	I rarely drive but the <strong>drivers license</strong> is good as small photo ID. And a <strong>passport</strong> for traveling.

	<li><strong>health</strong><br>
	Passes for insurance, vaccination, radiology & organ donation.

	<li class="external"><strong>external</strong><br>
	I love to <strong>bike</strong> so I always like using one wherever I’m at. I fixed up and gifted several bikes myself and usually someone has a bike they’re not using.
</ul>





<h1 id="dontown"><a href="#dontown">Stuff I don’t own</a></h1>
<ul>
	<li><strong>2nd pair of pants</strong><br>
	I used to have two, but pants don’t need to be washed that often. And if the one pair does, it dries overnight easily.
	<li><strong>belt</strong><br>
	Fitting pants don’t need a belt.
	<li><strong>state ID</strong><br>
	Is redundant because of passport and driver’s license.
	<li><strong>pocket knife</strong><br>
	I used to, but found I only use the blade or scissors anyway.
	<li><strong>underpants</strong><br>
	Yep, I just use the swimtrunks because they dry faster and are useful beyond being underpants.
	<li><strong>shampoo</strong><br>
	Soap works perfectly for that.
	<li><strong>medicine</strong><br>
	Rarely ever do I need medicine or band-aids. The tape and tissues work for this as well. When I really do need some, either someone has it or there’s a pharmacy.
	<li><strong>hat</strong><br>
	The only headgear I have is the jacket’s hood, and it suffices even for skiing in hail.
	<li><strong>power-USB adapter</strong><br>
	Mobile devices can be charged from the laptop, no need for an extra adapter.
	<li><strong>wallet</strong><br>
	Would be overkill for the few things I have to put in it. Either it’s in the jacket pockets or in the backpack.
</ul>
