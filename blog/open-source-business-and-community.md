# Open Source business

Open Source: licenses, resources, business models and building community.

This is the writeup and links of my workshop :) Hope it helps you, and please let me know if there are any questions! Or contact me via http://jancborchardt.net

## Why is it important?
- Working for social good
- Existing even when the company gets acquired or bankrupt
- Impact beyond the confines of company resources
	- [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) runs on only 3m$/year through donations, majority of content is contributed by volunteers
	- [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/): there’s lots of agencies & freelancers who offer hosting and services
	- [Maps.me](https://maps.me/) gets data from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
	- [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) has around 25 full-timers but hundreds of volunteers, and there’s a lot of other service providers
	- [Open Source Design](http://opensourcedesign.net/) is a distributed community with everyone working in their free time, in the process communicating and collaborating a lot
- Better security through ability to review everything. (See also latest macOS vulnerability.) There’s also communities where projects can work with security researchers like [Hacker One](https://www.hackerone.com)

## Resources
- **Icons** (all Creative Commons Attribution): [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com)
- **Fonts** (mostly Open Font license, no attribution required): [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com), [OpenFontLibrary](https://fontlibrary.org), [The League of Movable Type](https://theleagueofmoveabletype.com)
- **Photos** (all CC0, no attribution required): [Pexels](https://pexels.com), [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com), [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com)
- Simply include a list of credits on a page of the website. For individual publications such as presentations it’s good practice to include either picture credit in small on the slide itself, or on a slide at the end listing everything.

## Licenses
- **[Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/licensing-examples/) for text & media:** Recommended are Attribution or Attribution-ShareAlike
- **[AGPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License) for code:** Comparable to Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike, so other people need to also publish their changes under the same license. Easily explained at [tldrlegal.com](https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-affero-general-public-license-v3-(agpl-3.0))

## Working in the open
- Code and issues in the open, transparent process
- People are more likely to contribute than to start a different thing
- Community contributions, people participate, feeling of shared ownership
- Project is more trustworthy

## Actually doing it
- Have a space for people to participate and talk, like a [Discourse forum](https://www.discourse.org/)
	- [Open Source Design forum](https://discourse.opensourcedesign.net/)
	- [Nextcloud community help forum](https://help.nextcloud.com/categories)
- Start an organization on Github: (e.g [LensShift](https://github.com/LensShift))
	- Add your logo
	- Add the website link
	- Add people to it – make sure you have names and profile pictures set and set your visibility in the People list from private to public
- Create your first repository or move the existing project there
- Use the Issues for planning. Make it a habit to communicate in the open. Every issue has an original post and a discussion thread. You can assign people, labels and milestones for planning.
- You can create a »starter issue« label to mark things which could be done by new contributors. See [starter issues at Nextcloud](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/labels/starter%20issue) for example.
	- You can then register your project at [Up For Grabs](http://up-for-grabs.net) where projects with starter issues are showcased
	- And also contact the people of [Your First Pull Request](https://yourfirstpr.github.io) who will also spread the word
- There’s also a Trello-like kanban board called "Projects". See [example Project at Nextcloud](https://github.com/nextcloud/contacts/projects/1). You can use issues as cards but also add text notes which are not issues. You can have multiple projects.
- There is also a Wiki component where you can set up different pages: https://github.com/nextcloud/server/wiki
- If you need design work done, there is the [Open Source Design job board](http://opensourcedesign.net/jobs/) – you can simply submit a job (paying or not) via the [job submission form](http://opensourcedesign.net/jobs/job-form/)
