# Get designers involved in your open source project!
ðŸ’» + ðŸŽ¨ = ðŸ™‚

## Abstract
*One short paragraph that succinctly describes the event.*

Designers are not allergic to open source â€“ it often is just quite difficult and frustrating to get involved. Gladly there are some easy methods to make UX & UI folks feel welcome and get them contributing! :)

## Description
*A longer description of the event. Use this to give additional details that did not fit in the abstract. Both, abstract and description, will be shown on the conference website.*

Some of these methods include:
- Describe clearly what your project does
- Involving design from the start
- Using design tags in the issue tracker
- Have an easy landing page to get involved
- Cultivating a culture of design-driven decisions
â€“ and more! :)

We have a loose collective called Open Source Design which aims to bring together designers and open source projects. Some examples are the job board we have where projects can post their design jobs, and the Open Source Design tracks we established at well-known conferences like FOSDEM and FOSSASIA.


## Submission note
*Visible for admins and users, contains additional information.*

It would be really cool to also push forward design in the area of free software & open source at Congress!
