<h1>Talks</h1>
<em>Sharing ideas and projects. Let me know if you would like me to come to your conference.</em>

<h2>The Open Web, for everyone</h2>
<p>Projects like Diaspora, ownCloud, Unhosted and of course Mozilla are at the forefront of the open web movement. These initiatives aim to change the status quo of how web services work. Instead of advertising and tracking people, they are focused on empowering users and putting them back in control. This time not only through freedom of software but also with superior structure and usability. <a href="http://libreprojects.net">Libre Projects</a> is a collection of these open web services, focused on hosted apps which are directly usable for everyone.

<h2>Freedom from the web’s monopolies</h2> (the Unhosted movement)
<strong>The web is not as open as it used to be: monopoly platforms formed new proprietary layers on top of it. Apps always have storage attached to it, forming a package deal of »you get our app, we get your data«.</strong>
<p>We need to improve the web infrastructure by separating web application logic from per-user data storage: Users should be able to use web services they love but keep their life stored in one place they control. At the same time, application developers shouldn’t need to bother about providing data storage.<br />
We also believe that freedom on the web is not achieved by freely licensed web applications running on servers you can’t control. That’s why applications should be pure Javascript which runs client-side, all in the browser. It doesn’t matter if free or proprietary – everything can be inspected and verified.<br />
We are a non-profit movement aiming to re-decentralize the web, and you can help. You as app developers, you as hackers, you as citizens of a web that silently became centralized. Power to the web, power to the people.<br />
In this session I’ll present the remoteStorage standard efforts and how we aim to give people freedom, flexibility, and data ownership on the web.

<h2>Education and participation: students + open source projects = win-win!</h2>
<strong>In lots of lectures, students work on imaginary projects just for the sake of learning something. Or they can choose what they work on – mostly That Popular Proprietary Software™ which does not care about their contributions. We need to change that.</strong>
<p>We need to embrace the universities, collaborate with professors & lectures and mediate to further both learning and development: Students can contribute, gather experience in real projects and communicate with developers. Free software projects on the other hand need contributors, especially designers, and have a flexible working environment. This is based on learnings of a pilot project I currently do with Information Design students at Media University Stuttgart (Germany) and plan to expand.

<h2>Freedom 4: The freedom to use the program effectively, efficiently and satisfactory.</h2>
http://jancborchardt.net/usability-in-free-software
<strong>For a software to truly be free, people need to be able to easily use it without help. A primer to usability testing in a distributed and independent development environment.</strong>
<p>Presenting a collection of usability methods applicable especially in free & open source software projects. No matter if you are a developer, usability person or just enthusiastic about making software easier to use, these methods should help you get going. I will also share my experience from the projects I’m involved in, such as ownCloud and Unhosted.

<h2>Essential interface & interaction design</h2>
<strong>Despite all the talk about »user experience«, people seem to forget the core usability: registration, log in, sorting, search, menus, wording, notifications, errors, … – just the beginning of what even modern web applications still get wrong. This is a primer to what needs improvement. A collection of issues, design guidelines, examples and tools to make it happen.</strong>

registration: just email and password (maybe username), no repeat fields! (mailcheck.js), inline validation, show password, inline labels (TUMBLR), auto terms of service without checkbox, easy return to log in, no fucking arbitrary upward and downward limits!
log in: same as with registration (BagCheck), »forgot password« appears and uses email already put in
functions: use and seamlessly register (bitorama.com)
upload: pre-upload, queue → just directly upload!
sorting: by frequency+recency (favorites)
search: search directly (Google Instant) never no results, fuzzy matching
controls: proximity! (iOS copy paste) rather than menus
wording: url = address, RSS = news
notifications: keep to a minimum
errors: useful error sites, no fancy 404 (Github, http://box.mepholio.com/collections/1/recent etc all useless) instead search for the site and give suggestions
deletion: undo instead of warning! (Aza Raskin article, Gmail undo send)
cancel: make the button smaller than submit! don’t put the button next to confirm!
dates: relative dates (moment.js timeago plus fade) with absolute dates on hover (ownCloud)
file size: one unit instead of mixed, more info on hover (ownCloud)
settings: autosave
pagination: ugh. Only when necessary, otherwise autoloading
country selector: http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2011/11/10/redesigning-the-country-selector/ and chosen.js
icons: big icons for file types are so useless
alarm clock: single alarm doesn’t cut it. Snooze is not pressed in the morning
music player: stop is useless
calendar: logarithmic instead of 30 boxes, compress 0:00–6:00, mark weekends

morphing, feedback, keeping people informed (UX patterns), Gestalt laws, don’t repeat stuff

<h2>ownCloud: your personal web platform</h2>
<strong>ownCloud is a central place where you can store your files and documents. You don’t have to upload your personal data to central closed services like Google Drive, Dropbox or Ubuntu One. All the data is under your own control.</strong>
