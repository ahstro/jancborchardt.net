<p><em>The wall is not the last call of social. It is not even the current optimum.</em>

<p>When I lived in Israel & Palestine, there was a presentation by Facebook designer Ben Blumenfeld at Tel Aviv University. He started by explaining what he did before, among other things designing websites for TV shows at CBS: <q>Then I realized: If I do a good job, more people will watch TV.</q> He continued how he got to Facebook and presented his experiences and learnings.<br />
Wrapping up, there was a round of taking questions. I was thinking what I should ask – I knew I wanted to as k <em>something</em>. Bringing up <a href="http://diasporafoundation.org">Diaspora</a> or federated social networking in general seemed a bit trite and wouldn’t really accomplish anything. Then I remembered what he said in the beginning. I was taken for the last question:<br />
<q>Starting out you mentioned that when you were at CBS, you realized that if you do a good job, more people would watch TV. Now how do you make sure that people don’t watch Facebook all the time?</q><br />
Unexpected question, he admitted. In fact I didn’t even expect an answer, the question was intended for everyone to think about. He returned with an explanation on how they design for the mission of communication and also care for bringing people together outside Facebook. Not very convincing, because they obviously do not focus on that.

<p>Emails have become the new paper letters. Handcrafted, personally sent with information only relevant to that specific person instead of a catch-all posted to everyone you ever met.

at the same time, movements such as Occupy can radically spread through these networks. Even though people »just share« something, awareness is raised.
